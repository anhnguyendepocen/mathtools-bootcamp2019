# Mathtools Bootcamp

**Instructors**
Nikhil `np1742@nyu.edu`  
Pierre-Etienne `pef246@nyu.edu`

### Summary

This crash course is aimed at *absolute beginners* in scientific programming in general and in python in particular. It is intended for entering doctoral students in neuroscience and psychology.

The goal of this class is to enable students to successfully partake in more advanced classes (like Math Tools) and to give a practical introduction to data science.

The bootcamp is organized in 10 sessions (morning: 10-12, afternoon: 1:30-3:30) that will run August 26th-30st in Meyer 760. Sessions build on each other and use neuroscience-based examples and data.

**Course Learning Objectives**
  - Draw useful conclusions from data using computation
  - Use a scientific programming environment fluently
  - Translate, ask and answer basic neuroscience / psychology questions in this environment

**Installation Instructions**
  - [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/), choose python 3.7  
  - we will be using jupyterlab (installed with anaconda)

### Syllabus
